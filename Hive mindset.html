    <h1>The United States government has lied to us
    </h1>
    <p>Today I am here to discuss with you the propaganda the United States government has put up to the people to make them believe that we are powerful. I tell you that the United States is a country of fraud and deceipt
    </p>
    <p>I will be listening the top 5 major deceipts that the united states government has made the people believe. </p>
    <h2>1. The US faked the moon landing
    </h2>

    <p>The United States lied to its people with fake images of a fake moon landing. IT WAS ALL A GREEN SCREEN EFFECT. None of it was real. They never left earth and really the "space shuttle" was faked aswell as a attempt at beating russians to the chase
    </p>
    <h2>2. They staged the death of Tupac Shakur
    </h2>

    <p>They staged the death of Tupac Shakur for the reasoning that they could not stand to see a black man speaking out against the white man. Anytime a brother in the community speaks out against a higher authority they are meant to be afraid and beg on their knees for forgiveness.
